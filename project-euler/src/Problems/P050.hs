{-
 - The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:
 -     41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13
 -
 - This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below
 - one-hundred.
 -
 - The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to
 - a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.
 -
 - Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most
 - consecutive primes?
