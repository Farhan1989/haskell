module Problems.P032 (solve) where

{-
 - We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the
 - digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is
 - 1 through 5 pandigital.
 -
 - The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing
 - multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
 -
 - Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity
 - can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.  HINT: Some products can be
 - obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your
 - sum.
