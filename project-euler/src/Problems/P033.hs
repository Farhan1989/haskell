module Problems.P033 (solve) where

{-
 - The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician
 - in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which
 - is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.
 -
 - We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.
 -
 - There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less
 - than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and
 - denominator.
 -
 - If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms,
 - find the value of the denominator.
