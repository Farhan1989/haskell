module Problems.P130 (solve) where

{-
 - A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define
 - R(k) to be a repunit of length k; for example, R(6) = 111111.
 -
 - Given that n is a positive integer and GCD(n, 10) = 1, it can be shown that
 - there always exists a value, k, for which R(k) is divisible by n, and let
 - A(n) be the least such value of k; for example, A(7) = 6 and A(41) = 5.
 -
 - You are given that for all primes, p > 5, that p âˆ’ 1 is divisible by A(p).
 - For example, when p = 41, A(41) = 5, and 40 is divisible by 5.
 -
 - However, there are rare composite values for which this is also true; the
 - first five examples being 91, 259, 451, 481, and 703.
 -
 - Find the sum of the first twenty-five composite values of n for which GCD(n,
 - 10) = 1 and n âˆ’ 1 is divisible by A(n).
