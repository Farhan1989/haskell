{-
 - By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers
 - on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.
 -
 - 3
 - 7 4
 - 2 4 6
 - 8 5 9 3
 -
 - That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.
 -
 - Find the maximum total from top to bottom in 067.in, a 15K text file
 - containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.
 -
 - NOTE: This is a much more difficult version of Problem 18. It is not
 - possible to try every route to solve this problem, as there are 299
 - altogether! If you could check one trillion (10^12) routes every second it
 - would take over twenty billion years to check them all. There is an
 - efficient algorithm to solve it. ;o)
