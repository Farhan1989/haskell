{-
 - The cube, 41063625 (345^3), can be permuted to produce two other cubes:
 - 56623104 (384^3) and 66430125 (405^3). In fact, 41063625 is the smallest
 - cube which has exactly three permutations of its digits which are also cube.
 -
 - Find the smallest cube for which exactly five permutations of its digits are
 - cube.
