module Problems.P045 (solve) where

{-
 - Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following
 - formulae:
 -
 - Triangle         Tn=n(n+1)/2         1, 3,  6, 10, 15, ...
 - Pentagonal       Pn=n(3n−1)/2        1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...
 - Hexagonal        Hn=n(2n−1)          1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...
 -
 - It can be verified that T(285) = P(165) = H(143) = 40755.
 -
 - Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
