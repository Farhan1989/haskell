 - Although there exists no rectangular grid that contains exactly two million
 - rectangles, find the area of the grid with the nearest solution.

{-
 - In general, suppose we have a big rectangle of size (wb,hb).
 - If we want to put a smaller rectangle with upper-left corner at (x,y) then it
 - can have width w = [1..wb-x] and height h = [1..hb-h]. Since we can place a rectangle
 - at any point x = [0..wb-1] and y = [0..hb-1] we have
 -     Sum[1, {x,0,wb-w}, {y,0,hb-h}, {w,1,wb-x}, {h,1,hb-y}] == wb*(wb+1)*hb*(hb+1)/4
 -
 -
 - Now, the problem reduces to finding the point (w,h) with w,h >= 1
 - has `rects w h` as close to `target` as possible.
 -
 - Most of this code is for that general type of problem. Given a monotonically
 - increasing function `f`, find the lattice point where `f x y` is as close as
 - possible to a given value.
