 - In the following equation x, y, and z are positive integers.
 - 1/x + 1/y == 1/z
 -
 - It can be verified that when n = 1260 there are 113 distinct solutions and
 - this is the least value of n for which the total number of distinct
 - solutions exceeds one hundred.
 -
 - What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions
 - exceeds four million?
 -
 - NOTE: This problem is a much more difficult version of problem 108 and as it
 - is well beyond the limitations of a brute force approach it requires
 - a clever implementation.
