{-
 - Comparing two numbers written in index form like 2^11 and 3^7 is not
 - difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 2^11 = 2048 < 3^7 = 2187.
 -
 - However, confirming that 632382^518061 > 519432^525806 would be much more
 - difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.
 -
 - Using 099.in, a 22K text file containing one thousand lines with
 - a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the
 - greatest numerical value.
 -
 - NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example
 - given above.
