 - Looking at the table below, it is easy to verify that the maximum possible
 - sum of adjacent numbers in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal or
 - anti-diagonal) is 16 (= 8 + 7 + 1).
 -
 -     -2   5   3   2
 -      9  -6   5   1
 -      3   2   7   3
 -     -1   8  -4   8
 -
 - Now, let us repeat the search, but on a much larger scale:
 -
 - First, generate four million pseudo-random numbers using a specific form of
 - what is known as a "Lagged Fibonacci Generator":
 -
 - For 1 ≤ k ≤ 55, sk = [100003 - 200003k + 300007k3] (modulo 1000000) - 500000.
 - For 56 ≤ k ≤ 4000000, sk = [sk-24 + sk-55 + 1000000] (modulo 1000000) - 500000.
 -
 - Thus, s10 = -393027 and s100 = 86613.
 -
 - The terms of s are then arranged in a 2000×2000 table, using the first 2000
 - numbers to fill the first row (sequentially), the next 2000 numbers to fill
 - the second row, and so on.
 -
 - Finally, find the greatest sum of (any number of) adjacent entries in any
 - direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal or anti-diagonal).
