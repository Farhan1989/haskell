{-
 - The points P (x1, y1) and Q (x2, y2) are plotted at integer co-ordinates and
 - are joined to the origin, O (0,0), to form Î”OPQ.
 -
 -
 - There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be
 - formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is, 0  x1,
 - y1, x2, y2  2.
 -
 -
 - Given that 0 <= x1, y1, x2, y2 <= 50, how many right triangles can be formed?

-- The x1*y2 > x2*y1 thing is to avoid double-counting
-- We simply require that Q (at x2,y2) make a larger angle than P (at x1,y1)
-- Thus, theta2 > theta1

--  -->  y2/x2 > y1/x1
