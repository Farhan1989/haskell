{-
 - It turns out that 12 cm is the smallest length of wire that can be bent to
 - form an integer sided right angle triangle in exactly one way, but there are
 - many more examples.
 -
 - 12 cm: (3,4,5)
 - 24 cm: (6,8,10)
 - 30 cm: (5,12,13)
 - 36 cm: (9,12,15)
 - 40 cm: (8,15,17)
 - 48 cm: (12,16,20)
 -
 - In contrast, some lengths of wire, like 20 cm, cannot be bent to form an
 - integer sided right angle triangle, and other lengths allow more than one
 - solution to be found; for example, using 120 cm it is possible to form
 - exactly three different integer sided right angle triangles.
 -
 - 120 cm: (30,40,50), (20,48,52), (24,45,51)
 -
 - Given that L is the length of the wire, for how many values of L â‰¤ 1,500,000
 - can exactly one integer sided right angle triangle be formed?
 -
 - Note: This problem has been changed recently, please check that you are
 - using the right parameters.
