{-
 - Some positive integers n have the property that the sum [n + reverse(n)]
 - consists entirely of odd (decimal) digits. For instance, 36 + 63 = 99 and
 - 409 + 904 = 1313. We will call such numbers reversible; so 36, 63, 409, and
 - 904 are reversible. Leading zeroes are not allowed in either n or
 - reverse(n).
 -
 - There are 120 reversible numbers below one-thousand.
 -
 - How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion (109)?
