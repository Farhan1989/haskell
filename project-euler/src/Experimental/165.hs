{-
 - A segment is uniquely defined by its two endpoints. By considering two line
 - segments in plane geometry there are three possibilities: the segments have
 - zero points, one point, or infinitely many points in common.
 -
 - Moreover when two segments have exactly one point in common it might be the
 - case that that common point is an endpoint of either one of the segments or
 - of both. If a common point of two segments is not an endpoint of either of
 - the segments it is an interior point of both segments.  We will call
 - a common point T of two segments L1 and L2 a true intersection point of L1
 - and L2 if T is the only common point of L1 and L2 and T is an interior point
 - of both segments.
 -
 - Consider the three segments L1, L2, and L3:
 -
 - L1: (27, 44) to (12, 32)
 - L2: (46, 53) to (17, 62)
 - L3: (46, 70) to (22, 40)
 -
 - It can be verified that line segments L2 and L3 have a true intersection
 - point. We note that as the one of the end points of L3: (22,40) lies on L1
 - this is not considered to be a true point of intersection. L1 and L2 have no
 - common point. So among the three line segments, we find one true
 - intersection point.
 -
 - Now let us do the same for 5000 line segments. To this end, we generate
 - 20000 numbers using the so-called "Blum Blum Shub" pseudo-random number
 - generator.
 -
 - s0 = 290797
 -
 - sn+1 = sn√ósn (modulo 50515093)
 -
 - tn = sn (modulo 500)
 -
 - To create each line segment, we use four consecutive numbers tn. That is,
 - the first line segment is given by:
 -
 - (t1, t2) to (t3, t4)
 -
 - The first four numbers computed according to the above generator should be:
 - 27, 144, 12 and 232. The first segment would thus be (27,144) to (12,232).
 -
 - How many distinct true intersection points are found among the 5000 line
 - segments?
