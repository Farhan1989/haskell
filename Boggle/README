The program enclosed will solve the problem described in problem_statement.pdf

The input files have been modified in the following way:
    <board> files have had the first line, which has the number of layers in
        the board, removed

It can be compiled by executing:
    ghc -O2 -o boggle.exe Boggle.hs

It can be run by executing:
    ./boggle.exe <boardfile> <dictionaryfile>

Two example board files, and two example dictionary files, are provided
testboard1.in and testdictionary1.in are small, and run very fast
testboard2.in and testdictionary2.in are quite large, and will take ~1s to run
